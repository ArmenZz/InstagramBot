SINGLE ACCOUNT USE:
1. SET YOUR LIKE,VIEW,COMMENT LINKS AND FOLLOW USER ID IN THE CONFIG.INI FILE
2. ADD YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE FIRST SLOT IN CONFIG.INI
3. SET YOUR PASSWORD IN MAIN
======================================================================================================================
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS RECOMMENDATION:
-SET ALL OF YOUR ACCOUNTS IN THE DESIGNATED SLOTS IN CONFIG.INI
-HAVE THE SAME PASSWORD FOR ALL THE ACCOUNTS SO THAT THE PASSWORD IN MAIN CAN BE USED TO ITS FULL EXTENT
-COPY AND CREATE AS MANY ibot.py FILES AS MANY ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE AND CHANGE THE ACCOUNT PROFILE USED FOR EACH SCRIPT IN MAIN

eg. igbot1.py ------------------ insta = InstagramBot(config['ACCOUNTS']['account1'],'yourpassword')
    igbot2.py ------------------ insta = InstagramBot(config['ACCOUNTS']['account2'],'yourpassword')
    igbot3.py ------------------ insta = InstagramBot(config['ACCOUNTS']['account3'],'yourpassword')
    
-MAKE A BATCH FILE THAT RUNS ALL THE SCRIPTS AT THE SAME TIME
update: i have included one such file
